    "Hi! I am brand new to online dating. While I’m still figuring this all out, here’s something I know for sure—I’m excited to be here! The chance to meet unique, engaging, and interesting women is pretty dang neat. If you think you might fit that mold, drop me a message. I work in the finance industry. And while I like to work hard, I make sure to leave time to enjoy life. I’m a fan of wine, movies, hiking, and getting out of town for the weekend. Let’s chat and see if maybe we’re a good fit!",

    "Hi! If I had to pick three words to describe me they would be positive, a little shy, and someone who loves to laugh. Okay, that was a few more than three words, but it’s fun to break the rules from time to time, right? I’m new to online dating, but I know what I’m looking for in a man. My Christian faith is important to me, so I want to find a man who feels the same way. Additionally, I’m really into movies, so a guy who likes to cuddle up on the couch instead of going out on a Friday night is the right match for me. If you think maybe we could be right for each other, send me a message! I’m kind of shy, but if you reach out, I come out of my shell.",
    "Hi, I’m Ted! Thanks for stopping by my online dating profile. I’m not the best at describing myself, so I reached out to a few friends and asked them to tell me what I’m like so I could share that with you. Here’s what they had to say. Ted is driven, goal-oriented, and goes after what he wants in life.Ted is a real catch. He’s caring, dependable, and someone who could really be your rock. If you want to see if my friends are right or they’re just telling me what I want to hear (kidding), we should chat! Send me a message and let’s start the conversation..",
    "Hi, I'm Joe. I'm an attorney by day, and in my spare time, I'm writing my first novel. Training for the next marathon is my go-to stress relief. I'm an avid reader of the Economist and the Atlantic. I keep up-to-date with politics but try to stay out of the drama. Early morning meditation is my spiritual practice. My ex-wife and I co-parent our two kids. I'm here on this app to meet you so can you do me one favor to help me out? I have a quick question for you to answer. What's the first date you've always wanted to go on and have never come close to? Click the message button and let me know!",
